        This is where it all happens. Take a look at my new projects, websites, game art, and design portfolio.
        I will try to post information regularly and I hope you come back and add this site as a bookmark.
        Iâ€™ve got lots of information to share.
        Enjoy browsing and have fun!
        I have recently started mobile, web and applications development and it is a passion of mine.
        It has been a long time coming that I end up working on something application or programming related.
        It brings me lots of joy and excitement to make applications, games, websites and pixel art.
        I mainly use Javascript and Typescript at the moment but I have decent experience with a few other languages.
        Please enjoy my site and browse my collections and projects.
